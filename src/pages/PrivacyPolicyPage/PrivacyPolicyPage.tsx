          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The following is from the Confidentiality section of the national
            council for geocosmic research’s “Code of Ethics". As a professional
            astrologer with integrity, AND AS a Member of the NCGR, I adhere to
            all of these codes and apply them in all of my practices:
          </p>

          <h2>Maintaining Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            a) Astrologers respect the confidentiality and rights to privacy of
            their clients, students and others who they deal with in
            astrological contexts. Confidentiality applies to the identity of
            and personal information about clients and other individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            b) Astrologers do not disclose personal information that is
            unattainable from public sources without the consent of the person
            involved as long as that person is living.
          </p>

          <h2>Consultations With Colleagues</h2>
          <p>
            When consulting with colleagues, astrologers do not share the
            identity of the person or persons involved without prior consent. If
            unavoidable, they share only that information which is necessary to
            achieve the purposes of the consultation.
          </p>

          <h2>Confidential Information in Data Collections</h2>
          <p>
            Astrologers seek permission from living subjects (such as clients,
            students and friends) before including confidential information in
            named data collections. Alternatively, astrologers use coding or
            other techniques to protect the identity of the subjects.
