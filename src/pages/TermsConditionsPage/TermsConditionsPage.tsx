          <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>
            a) If you need to cancel an appointment, I require 24 hour notice.
            Cancellation infers that no services are rendered and a refund will
            be issued. Refunds can take 5-7 business days to show up in your
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            b) Clients who cancel after the 24 hour window has passed will not
            receive a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            c) Clients who do not show up for their appointment will not receive
            a refund. Note: Clients who are more than 15 minutes late for their
            session will be considered “no shows,” will lose their appointment
            slot, and will not receive a refund.
          </p>

          <h2>Rescheduling Policy</h2>
          <p>
            a) Clients can always reschedule their appointment. To reschedule an
            appointment with no penalty, I require 24 hour notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            b) Clients who reschedule after the 24 hour window, but before their
            appointment, will incur a $15 fee. Clients who reschedule after
            missing their appointment will incur a $30 fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            c) A fee can only be waived due to an emergency, and I must receive
            email notification within 48 hours of the original appointment slot.
            Failure to notify me will result in the aforementioned, respective
            penalty charges.
